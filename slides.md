# API Architectures

API architecture is the framework of principles, practices, and patterns that guide the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

<div v-click class="text-red-400">
  Here are some common and popular API architectures :

## API Testing

API Testing is the process of validating and verifying Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It ensures the API‚Äôs functionality, performance, reliability, and security. The focus is on checking requests and responses, data formats, and communication between systems, without a UI, to catch errors early and ensure seamless integration between components.

Test Flight, Ad-hoc Testing, UI Testing, Exploratory Testing

# Functional Testing

- Goal: Check whether the API meets its functionality requirements.
- Example: Testing if an API correctly returns user information when called with the right ID.

# Load Testing

- Goal: Verify API performance under heavy traffic.
- Example: Simulating multiple requests to ensure the API handles concurrent users efficiently.

## Runtime / Performance 

- Goal: Monitor API behavior under execution to ensure performance.
- Example: Checking API response times during peak load.

# UI Testing

- Goal: Ensure smooth interaction between the frontend and API.
- Example: Validating whether the UI displays correct data fetched from the API.

# Fuzz Testing

- Goal: Test the robustness of an API by sending random or invalid data.
- Example: Ensuring that the API can gracefully handle unexpected input without crashing.


---
layout: center
class: w-[80%] m-auto
---

## Best Practices for API Testing
- Test Early and Often: Integrate API tests in CI/CD pipelines.
- Automate: Use tools like Postman, SoapUI, or JMeter.
- Monitor Performance: Use APM tools to track response times and system behavior.
- Secure Your API: Implement authentication, authorization, and encryption checks.
- Test in Different Scenarios: Consider edge cases, invalid inputs, and large data sets.

# Serverless

Serverless is a cloud-native model where developers focus on writing code without managing underlying infrastructure.

<!-- Serverless doesnot mean there is no server, it simply means that you don't operate your own server, typically building a server environment requires time and maintenance effort to make sure it's always running and bug free since you are responsible for that server. -->

Advantages
- Have not to worry about handles server management, scaling, and maintenance
- Easy Integration
- Less Maintenance
- Simple Scaling
- Focus on CODE rather than Infrastructure

### Example Providers

 AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions

## Example Use Case
#### Real-time File Processing:

- User uploads file to cloud storage (e.g., S3 bucket).
- Triggers a Lambda function that processes and stores the result.
- Scalable and cost-effective for on-demand processing tasks.

### Edge Computing

Edge Computing refers to processing data closer to the source of data generation rather than relying on a centralized data-processing warehouse. It minimizes latency, reduces bandwidth usage, and enhances real-time data processing.

Key Advantages

- Reduced Latency: Faster response times for applications requiring real-time data processing.
- Bandwidth Efficiency: Reduces the amount of data sent to central servers, saving bandwidth.
- Enhanced Security: Sensitive data can be processed locally, reducing exposure to external threats.
- Scalability: Easier to scale as more edge devices can be added without overloading central systems.

Future Trends
- Increased AI Integration: More edge devices will incorporate AI for advanced analytics and decision-making.

# Monolithic

Monolithic architecture is a software design where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit.

Characteristics:

- Single codebase
- Tight coupling of features
- Single database for all components
- Everything deployed and scaled together

# Microservices

<!-- When to Use Microservices?

When scaling is crucial: Apps with high traffic and need for independent scaling.
Frequent updates: Applications that require regular updates without downtime.
Decentralized teams: Teams working on different parts of the application independently.
Slide 11: When NOT to Use Microservices?

Small Projects: If the application is simple and doesn‚Äôt need complex scaling.
Teams new to microservices: The learning curve might slow development initially.
Real-time, latency-sensitive apps: Microservices might add network latency. -->

Microservices are a software architecture style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services.

Characteristics:

- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Decentralized data management
<!-- 
Tools & Technologies for Microservices

- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Service Discovery: Consul, Eureka
- API Gateway: Kong, NGINX
- Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) -->
