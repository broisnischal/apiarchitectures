# API Architectures

API architecture is the framework of principles, practices, and patterns that guide the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).


##### Choosing <span v-mark.underline.black>Technology</span> Overhead!
<!--
Technology overhead" refers to the additional complexity, resources, or effort required to manage, implement, or maintain a particular technology.  -->

1.Learning curve for the technology<br/>
2.Performance impact (CPU, memory usage)<br/>
3.Setup, configuration, and integration efforts<br/>
4.Maintenance (updates, bug fixes, etc.)<br/>
5.Costs (licenses, infrastructure requirements)<br/>

<!-- Technology overhead" refers to the additional complexity, resources, or effort required to manage, implement, or maintain a particular technology. This can include factors such as:


Choosing technology overhead means considering these trade-offs when selecting tools, frameworks, or platforms for a project, to avoid unnecessary complications and ensure efficiency. -->

- Indexing  ( Clustered , Non-Clustered )

<!-- example toc, book ko agadi ko  
 allowing the database to find rows quickly without scanning the entire table
 -->

<!-- Check the query patterns of your application and create the right indexes.  -->
- Materialized Views
<!-- Pre-compute complex query results and store them for faster access.  -->
- Denormalization 
<!-- Reduce complex joins to improve query performance.  -->
- Vertical Scaling
<!-- Boost your database server by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage.  -->
- Database Sharding
<!-- Split large tables into multiple smaller tables to improve query performance.  -->
- Database Replication
<!-- Create replicas of your primary database on different servers for scaling the reads.  -->
<!-- Allow multiple instances of your database to replicate your data.  -->
Caching
<!-- boost speed with Semantic Cache -->
<!-- Cache frequently used data to reduce server load. -->

<!-- where the data is stored based on its meaning or query context rather than physical storage locations or simple key-value pairs. Instead of caching the result of specific queries, semantic caching focuses on storing parts of queries (sub-queries) and their results, so that when similar queries are made, they can be served using previously cached data. -->

<!-- Partial Query Results: Stores portions of query results, allowing faster future queries that overlap with the cached ones.
Efficient Cache Reuse: Handles similar queries by using previously cached fragments.
Optimization: Reduces redundant database hits, optimizing query performance. -->

## API Testing

API Testing is the process of validating and verifying Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It ensures the API‚Äôs functionality, performance, reliability, and security. The focus is on checking requests and responses, data formats, and communication between systems, without a UI, to catch errors early and ensure seamless integration between components.

Test Flight, Ad-hoc Testing, UI Testing, Exploratory Testing

## Best Practices for API Testing
- Test Early and Often: Integrate API tests in CI/CD pipelines.
- Automate: Use tools like Postman, SoapUI, or JMeter.
- Monitor Performance: Use APM tools to track response times and system behavior.
- Secure Your API: Implement authentication, authorization, and encryption checks.
- Test in Different Scenarios: Consider edge cases, invalid inputs, and large data sets.

# Serverless

Serverless is a cloud-native model where developers focus on writing code without managing underlying infrastructure.

<!-- Serverless doesnot mean there is no server, it simply means that you don't operate your own server, typically building a server environment requires time and maintenance effort to make sure it's always running and bug free since you are responsible for that server. -->

Advantages
- Have not to worry about handles server management, scaling, and maintenance
- Easy Integration
- Less Maintenance
- Simple Scaling
- Focus on CODE rather than Infrastructure

### Example Providers

 AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions

## Example Use Case
#### Real-time File Processing:

- User uploads file to cloud storage (e.g., S3 bucket).
- Triggers a Lambda function that processes and stores the result.
- Scalable and cost-effective for on-demand processing tasks.

### Edge Computing

Edge Computing refers to processing data closer to the source of data generation rather than relying on a centralized data-processing warehouse. It minimizes latency, reduces bandwidth usage, and enhances real-time data processing.

Key Advantages

- Reduced Latency: Faster response times for applications requiring real-time data processing.
- Bandwidth Efficiency: Reduces the amount of data sent to central servers, saving bandwidth.
- Enhanced Security: Sensitive data can be processed locally, reducing exposure to external threats.
- Scalability: Easier to scale as more edge devices can be added without overloading central systems.

Future Trends
- Increased AI Integration: More edge devices will incorporate AI for advanced analytics and decision-making.

<!-- Simplicity: Easier to develop, test, and deploy as a single application.
Performance: No inter-service communication overhead, everything runs in-process.
Less Overhead: Fewer infrastructure requirements compared to microservices.
Easier Debugging: All components are in one codebase, making it easier to track issues. -->

# Monolithic

Monolithic architecture is a software design where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit.

Characteristics:

- Single codebase
- Tight coupling of features
- Single database for all components
- Everything deployed and scaled together


Monorepo, Multi-tenant

<!-- multi-tenant application is designed to serve multiple customers (tenants) using a single instance of the software. Each tenant's data is isolated and secure, while they share the application's resources and infrastructure. Tenants can be individuals, companies, or user groups, each having their unique configurations, such as UI, data storage, or authentication settings.

Common approaches to multi-tenancy include:

- Shared Database, Shared Schema: All tenants share the same database and tables, with tenant-specific data identified by a unique key.
- Shared Database, Separate Schema: Each tenant has its own schema in a shared database.
- Separate Database: Each tenant has a completely separate database. -->

::right::
# Microservices

<!-- When to Use Microservices?

When scaling is crucial: Apps with high traffic and need for independent scaling.
Frequent updates: Applications that require regular updates without downtime.
Decentralized teams: Teams working on different parts of the application independently.
Slide 11: When NOT to Use Microservices?

Small Projects: If the application is simple and doesn‚Äôt need complex scaling.
Teams new to microservices: The learning curve might slow development initially.
Real-time, latency-sensitive apps: Microservices might add network latency. -->

Microservices are a software architecture style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services.

Characteristics:

- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Decentralized data management
<!-- 
Tools & Technologies for Microservices

- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Service Discovery: Consul, Eureka
- API Gateway: Kong, NGINX
- Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) -->
